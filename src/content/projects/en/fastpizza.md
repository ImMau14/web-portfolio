# FastPizza Application

This desktop application is designed for comprehensive sales management. It allows for the calculation of total daily sales, offers real-time dollar exchange rates, generates reports in PDF format, and facilitates database management, among other key functionalities.

Currently, the project is in its prototype phase. The development of a new version is planned, which will incorporate improvements and corrections.

> This project represents my first professional experience as a programmer. My role encompasses defining the technologies to be used, UX/UI design, and a part of the _backend_ development and database management.
