# Folderlan

Folderlan is the perfect solution for transferring documents, photos, videos, and more, without the need for the internet, Bluetooth, or cables. Simply connect your devices to the same Wi-Fi network and start sharing with an interface so intuitive that anyone can use it.

Currently under development, Folderlan is expected to be available in 2026.

> Folderlan is a tool that arose from the need to transfer files without access to Bluetooth, the internet, or cables. It is being developed in Rust, a language chosen for its speed, scalability, and compiled nature, which enables 'plug and play' usage. It represents my largest project to date, and its public release is imminent.
