# TScrapingBot Website

This project involves the development of the official website for TScrapingBot, a Telegram bot. The site incorporates dynamic animations and multi-language support, offering an enriched user experience.

> It was conceived as an opportunity to delve into Astro and TypeScript. The main objective of this development was to gain practical experience and consolidate knowledge in both technologies, applying them to a modern web project.
