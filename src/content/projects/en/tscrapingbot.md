# TScrapingBot

TScrapingBot is a sophisticated Telegram bot that automates web scraping and information analysis, powered by the Gemini 2.5 LLM.

It offers intelligent responses, in-depth web content analysis, a dedicated reasoning mode, and conventional memory capabilities.

Developed in Python, it seamlessly integrates Gemini 2.5, Scrape.do, and Supabase, enabling efficient data extraction and smart queries directly from Telegram.

The underlying technologies may evolve in the future to further enhance the bot's efficiency.

> Bringing this project to life has been a truly fascinating journey. The idea stemmed from my desire to find a way to analyze any webpage using AI, making it as simple as sending a message. During the process, I delved into the intricacies of Telegram updates and gained valuable experience with Supabase and Render deployments.<br/><br/>
> This project marked my first significant tool as a programmer—one I continue to use and refine to this day.
