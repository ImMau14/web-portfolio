# My Web Portfolio

Web portfolio developed with Astro and TypeScript, using React components and TailwindCSS for styling. It includes a content section managed with Content Layer to publish articles written in Markdown and translations in multiple languages.

> This project allowed me to explore Astro’s content workflow and confirmed why I consider it one of my favorite frontend frameworks.
